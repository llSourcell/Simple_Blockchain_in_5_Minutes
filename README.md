# Simple_Blockchain_in_5_Minutes

## Overview 

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/MViBvQXQ3mM) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on building a simple blockchain. 

## Dependencies

* hashlib
* datetime

Dependencies can be installed using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). But actually just run this in colab so you don't need to install anything. 

## Usage 

You can download the juypter notebook and run it locally. Also, here is the [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sLAFXSa9S_R2CWLPNrPCJ05Px52FbQeI) link to run it in the browser (recommended). 

## Credits

The credits for the original code go to [howcodeORG](https://github.com/howCodeORG/Simple-Python-Blockchain). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
